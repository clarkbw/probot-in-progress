# in-progress

> a GitHub App built with [probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that automatically labels issues with the `in-progress` label when an open PR uses the [GitHub issue keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/)

## Setup

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

See [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) if you would like to run your own instance of this app.
